**Disclaimer**

> This presentation was created by **Marcin Wichary** and modified by many people in the
> *Google Chrome team*.
>    
> The purpose of the presentation is to show the coming bleeding edge features
> for modern desktop and mobile browsers.
>
> The presentation was originally meant to run in **Google Chrome**. Some experimental
> features **might or might not** be coded to run in other browsers for now.
> (Although you will cry out of happiness when you see so much running in IE with
> the Chrome Frame plug-in).
>
> If you want to run 100% of the demos contained in the presentation you might need to run
> Developer Channel Chrome or Google Chrome Canary (on Windows).
>
> There is a [code repository](https://github.com/html5rocks/slides.html5rocks.com)
