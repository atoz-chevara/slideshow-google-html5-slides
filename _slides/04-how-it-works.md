The Slide Show (S9) Ruby gem turns your slides in plain text into a web page
that's an all-in-one-page handout and a live slide show all at once.

```
$ slideshow build tutorial

=> Preparing slideshow 'tutorial.html'...
=> Done.
```

Turn your web page into a slide show and your browser into full screen projection
with a single push button (F11).  Hit the space bar or the right arrow, down arrow
or page down key to flip through your slides.

That's all. It's that simple.
